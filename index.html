            <h2>Penguin Stampede Kills Activist &mdash; Autopsy Finds <u>Their</u> Remains In His Remains</h2>
            <img src="images/savory-penguin.jpg" alt="savory-penguin" width="150">
            <p>In an astonishing twist, an animal rights activist was tragically trampled by a rogue colony of emperor
                penguins at a remote Antarctic research station. The activist, known for his close contact campaigns,
                had entered a protected nesting zone in a penguin suit as part of a protest. Witnesses say the birds
                charged unexpectedly, possibly perceiving a threat. The shock deepened when an autopsy revealed that the
                activist had consumed a penguin prior to the incident — possibly as a survival tactic. The irony has
                ignited online debate, while authorities investigate the legality and ethics of the activist’s final
                actions.</p>

            <h2>Wolverine Saves Boy Scout Troop From Cannibals</h2>
            <img src="images/humble_hero.jpg" alt="humble_hero" width="150">
            <p>In a harrowing wilderness rescue, a wild wolverine became an unlikely hero after protecting a lost Boy
                Scout troop from a group of suspected cannibals in northern Canada. The troop, stranded during a
                backpacking trip gone wrong, encountered the hostile individuals late one night. As tensions rose, the
                wolverine reportedly burst from the underbrush, viciously attacking the would-be predators and buying
                the scouts time to escape. Mounties later confirmed injuries consistent with wolverine attacks on the
                suspects, now in custody. The scouts are shaken but safe. The creature, dubbed “Scout,” is being hailed
                as a feral guardian angel.</p>

            <h2>Corpse Of Beloved Giraffe Found &mdash; Neck Covered With Hickies</h2>
            <img src="images/giraffe.jpg" alt="giraffe" width="200">
            <p>Tragedy struck a popular safari park when the lifeless body of Gerald, a 12-year-old giraffe beloved by
                locals and tourists alike, was discovered under mysterious circumstances. Staff were shocked to find the
                giraffe’s famously long neck covered in what appeared to be large hickies or suction marks. While
                initial speculation ran wild—from interspecies romance to alien activity—veterinarians now believe the
                marks were caused by overzealous mating behavior from other giraffes. Gerald, a known flirt, may have
                been overwhelmed by affection. The park is boosting supervision of animal interactions and grief
                counseling is being offered to especially devastated visitors.</p>
